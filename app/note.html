            <p>Flight is our turnkey Drupal Distribution. It aims to take care of the mundane and frustrating tasks in every site build: downloading modules, setting up standard content types, configuring media, and creating a subtheme. It is for developers and site builders, but we have plans to create beatiful, flexible subthemes for everyone in the near future.</p>
            <h3>Completely open-source</h3>
            <p>That doesn't just mean code.  We have open-sourced our entire development workflow, including a Drupal Planning Document, inspired by Larry Garfield's blog post.  We have also open-sourced standard documentation, including short screencasts, with contextual help links links scattered throughout the administrative interface.  Good training is essential to any successful Content Management System implementation. Now your content administrators will be able to go back and find the part they missed when they were dosing off during training.</p>
            <h3>Built with Foundation</h3>
            <p>We use Zurb Foundation throughout our entire build cycle to quickly prototype, mockup, and build out responsive-first websites.  By using their flexible grid system, combined with Display Suite's granular control of field HTML code, we have been able to build a boatload of sites with far fewer man-hours.  Sprinkle in our most-used SASS mixins, and a Grunt workflow to clone, build and auto-reload pages and and you finally have an efficient theming worflow.  To top it off, we have created a number of field Display Formatters to take advantage of Foundation's useful Javascript libraries (slideshows, dropdowns, modals, oh my!).</p>
